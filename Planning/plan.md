# Plan 
Project Description resulting from design exercise

Chess games and tourneys for automated players. Framework for running fair games for autonomous players. Goal is to run tourneys where every signed up player gets a chance to participate in several rounds of Chess games. In some manner.

Project Analysis:
Part 1: identifiable components of software system
- pieces that make up an automated player
- pieces that make up the game software
- who knows what, who needs to know what and how is communication done (they being pieces of software). Sketch a UML-ish sequence diagram for this in local.md
- what is needed as common knowledge to make communication successful?

Part 2: how you should proceed about implementing these pieces. Demo software soon pls. Memo shouldn't exceed two pages, at most one page per part hmm.

I want to support the FEN system of denoting chess games.

So (Forsyth Edwards Notation) is what FEN means, should be able to find summaries of it online, but it's basically a way to compress the blank parts of the board into a numeral and record any pieces that are placed as a letter, either capital or not capital
